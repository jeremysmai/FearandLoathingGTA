# Fear and Loathing GTARP
The Official Fear and Loathing GTARP server project. The goal is to make a custom GTA experience on the server, set by our vision outlined in "GTA RP - OUR WAY - RoadMap"

### INTRO :scroll:
Since many of the mods have gone down or aren't supported this will partially act as an archive.

[Site Link](https://jeremysmai.github.io/FearandLoathingGTA/)

### News :newspaper:
- Officially created this repo!
- Created the first backup of the site and server. Files included above!
- SITE OVERHAUL! Reworked the whole site to carry a theme, added new pages and fixed somethings.

### Downloads :arrow_down:
Below you will find a guide and links to all necessary downloads required to get the server up and running.

Software needed to get the mods to run.
Name | Description | Link
------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------
FiveM | The official GTA private server launcher | [Download](https://fivem.net/)

This server build is very old so this page may take some time to fill out as I get familiar with the Mods and their function.
List of Mods that are included in ServerBuild.zip
Name | Description | Link

es_extended | UI mod
esplugin_mysql |

### Install :open_file_folder:
- Start with having GTA 5 installed.
- Next Install FiveM, it'll create a folder called fxserver, remember this location for next step.
- Now you can unpack all items included in and ServerBuild.zip into the same directory where FiveM placed fxserver folder.
- Run startGTAserver.bat - Join running server from FiveM launcher (localhost ip address is used)

### To Do :memo:
- [ ] Buy a Domain to use for this site or maybe just page host?
- [x] Upload the current state and backup of GTARP server files
- [ ] Create a detailed list of all used plugins and mods etc.
- [ ] Figure out how to present the gallery modal or raw image.
