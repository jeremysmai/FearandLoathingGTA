# Fear and Loathing GTARP Project
The Official FearandLoathing GTARP server project.

[Site Link](https://)

### NEWS :new:
- Officially created this repo!

### INTRO :book:
Since many of the mods have gone down or aren't supported this will partially act as an archive. FXServer.zip contains all required FXServer files and then some to get a GTA private server up and running. I don't claim to own any of the files within, just minor changes I might have made. This goes for most of this REPO.

### DOWNLOAD :arrow_down:
Below you will find a guide and links to all necessary downloads required to get the server up and running.

Software needed to get the mods to run.

### INSTALL :open_file_folder:
- Start with having GTA 5 installed.
- Next Install FiveM, it'll create a folder called fxserver, remember this location for next step.
- Now you can unpack all items included in and ServerBuild.zip into the same directory where FiveM placed fxserver folder.
- Run startGTAserver.bat - Join running server from FiveM launcher (localhost ip address is used)

### TO DO :memo:
